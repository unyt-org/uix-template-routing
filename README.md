# UIX Template: Routing

This repository provides a simple UIX setup, including backend and frontend, a docker deployment configuration and configuration files.

# Project Structure

## Directories
The source code is split into two directories. 

The `backend` directory contains the backend endpoint logic. The backend endpoint runs locally with deno.

The `frontend` directory contains the code for the frontend clients (running in the web browser).
The `entrypoint.ts` module is loaded on the frontend client. The default export of this module is used as the UI root element.
You can optionally also add an `entrypoint.ts` to the `backend` directory.

The directory names are important to tell UIX which code runs on which endpoint. The default names can also be changed in the `app.dx` config file.

## app.dx

The `app.dx` configuration file (an `app.json` file can also be used) is required for a UIX app to run. It at least needs to contain the app name.
The `app.dx` has to be placed next to the app directories (`frontend` and `backend`) in the default configuration.

# Cross realm imports

Frontend modules can import exported values from the backend modules.
In the background, special interface module files are generated, making sure that the backend source code is never exposed to the frontend endpoints.

Access to these exports can be limited by setting DATEX permission filters.
